Edit: Please see post #24 below for an updated code.

I have done something similar. I had a 64 Bit COM DLL that I wanted to talk to. The way it's done is by calling the API version of CreateObject(), and asks it to use the 64-Bit Dllhost.exe to host the 64-Bit COM DLL, then talk to it. This requires adding a registry entry at install time so Dllhost.exe is used. The value is of type String, and it should be left empty. Here is the registry entry that you need to create:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\APPID\{AppID_value}
DllSurrogate=""

To use CreateObject64() below, you call it like this:

Dim o64 As Object

Set o64 = CreateObject64("Project1.Class1")

There is no error handling, but you could add Err.Raise, or add an extra ByRef parameter to return error information.
