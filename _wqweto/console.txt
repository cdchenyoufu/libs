    Const InIde         As Boolean = False '-- make this a function
    Const StdOut        As Long = 1
    Static oStdOut      As Object
    
    If InIde Then
        Debug.Print sText;
    Else
        If oStdOut Is Nothing Then
            With CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
                Set oStdOut = .GetStandardStream(StdOut)
            End With
        End If
